Todo catalog all possible compiler errors

Main compiler:

cuda_tasks loop alone
Duplicate cuda_tasks iter variable name
Invalid statement after cuda_tasks loop
Missing cuda_tasks loop
Grid constant window
cuda_tasks loop must appear only in top level...
Unexpected loop mode in CudaDeviceFunction
CudaBasicDeviceVisible
expect_SyncStmt???
Number of intervals in barrier wrong...
Unexpected with context type
Solitary barrier error
SMEM allocation const shape
---
Write must be executed by one thread only
Top-level CudaWarps must provide
CTA must not be subdivided by parent cuda_threads loop
Wrong coll_unit for instr
cuda_threads 0/const hi
CudaWarps out-of-range
CudaWarps cannot change warp name
CudaWarps must define lo and hi


Barrier Usage:

incompatible sync-tl
incompatible multicasts
no back queue barrier
no multicast support
N != 1
uniform N

Distributed memory

Mbarrier multicast on intra-CTA dimension
Convergence requirement
Mismatched #distributed dims
Mismatched distributed dim values
Barrier: tile size mismatches leaf threads
Inconsistent collective tiling with previous
Expected point, not interval
Expected 0:const
Expected single variable name
Iter not from cuda_threads
Mismatched extent
Repeated? index
Overshot
SyncStmt 0:const_extent
Wrong collective unit at point of allocation
Tried to allocate under x loop
mismatches #distributed dims
Mismatched distributed dims

mem_analysis:

WindowStmt input memory
call mem type
does not take trailing barrier expression
requires trailing barrier expression
intact packed dimensions
multiple barriers, different variable
multiple barriers, different sidedness
missing something
check_pairing issues

InstrTimelineAnalysis:

Wrong parent instr-tl
Memory type alloc/read/write
Assign/Reduce
WindowStmt
SyncStmt
Call
Read
warn_weird_letters

coll_algebra

CollSizeExpr broken division [or remove this feature?]
