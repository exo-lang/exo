# System Overview

This document provides an overview of the Exo compilation process, as illustrated in Figure 1 of the PLDI'22 paper.

The Exo compiler's frontend starts by parsing the Python AST and constructing the Untyped Exo AST (UAST).
It then runs various frontend checks before converting the UAST into LoopIR, which serves as Exo's primary IR.
Exo supports rewrite-based user-scheduling, where scheduling primitives take a LoopIR and returns another (transformed) LoopIR.
These primitives take the immutable LoopIR and rewrite it into a new LoopIR.
Finally, in the backend, the optimized LoopIR is code-generated into C code.

The input to the compiler is a set of Exo source files (`*.py`), and the output is generated C code (`*.c`).

In this repository, folders are structured as follows:

1. `src/exo` is where the core Exo implementation resides.
    - **APIs.**
      - `API.py` defines a stable API for top-level decorators (`proc`, `instr`, and `config`).
      - `API_scheduling.py` defines a API for scheduling primitives.
      - `API_cursors.py` defines a API for Cursors.
    - **Standard libraries.** These could be user-defined, but we provide them for convenience.
      - `libs/` contains some common memory definitions (`memories.py`) and custom malloc implementations. 
      - `platforms/` contains instruction definitions that are part of the release.
      - `stdlib/` contains user-level scheduling functions such as `vectorize`.
    - Other files are implementation of Exo (e.g., `typecheck.py` implements typecheck), are not exposed to users.
2. `apps/` contains some sample applications written in Exo.
3. `dependencies/` contains submodules that Exo's apps and testing depends on.
4. `examples/` contains examples of scheduling with Exo.
5. `tests/` contains the Exo test suite.
6. `docs/` contains additional Exo documentation.

## Core

`src/exo/core` defines IRs used in Exo and other core implementations.
- `LoopIR.py` is the main file that defines IRs (LoopIR, UAST, PAST), and their visitor functions (LoopIR_Do, LoopIR_Rewrite). 
- `LoopIR_pprint.py` implements a printing procedure for the IRs defined in `LoopIR.py`.
- `prelude.py` defines `Sym` and `Srcinfo`.

User-defined features like config, externs, and Memory's parent class implementations are in `configs.py`, `extern.py`, and `memory.py`, respectively.

`internal_cursors` defines primitive cursor movements (see Section 5.2 "Cursor implementation" of [our ASPLOS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07211)) that are used internally by `LoopIR_scheduling` implementations of scheduling primitives.
`proc_eqv.py` defines a union-find tree which we use to track the equivalence of procedures.

## Frontend

`API.py` provides various user-facing entry points to Exo. The frontend consists of three types of parsing passes, all of which are located in the `src/exo/frontend` directory.

### Procedures

The `@proc` and `@instr` decorators are defined in this section and call into the `Pyparser`. The frontend workflow is as follows:
```
API -> Parser -> TypeCheck -> BoundsCheck/AssertCheck
```

`frontend/pyparser.py` defines a parser that translates the Python AST to UAST/PAST. Instead of implementing a custom lexer, Exo relies on the Python lexer to build the Python AST and hijacks it to translate it into Exo's internal ASTs. UAST (Untyped AST) is an untyped version of LoopIR (LoopIR is the "Exo IR" in the paper terminology). UAST is used when parsing full procedure definitions (`@proc` or `@instr`). PAST (Pattern AST) is an AST with holes, used to parse fragments from the user code outside the procedure (see next two sections).

`typecheck.py` performs type checking and converts UAST to LoopIR.
`boundscheck.py` checks for any out-of-bounds errors in the frontend code and ensures that all assertions in the code are satisfiable by invoking an SMT solver.

### New LoopIR Expressions

Some scheduling primitives (such as `expand_dim` and all primitives that take `NewExprA` as an argument) require the construction of new LoopIR expressions.
`parse_fragment.py` implements this pass by calling into `pyparser.pattern`, which invokes the parser with `is_fragment=True`.
When parsing new expressions, it is not possible to use holes `_`. Holes are used for pattern matching for obtaining a cursor reference.

### Pattern Match for Reference

Cursors can be obtained by pattern matching. The pattern gets parsed into PAST and then matched against the LoopIR to obtain a reference.
`frontend/pattern_match.py` implements this functionality.

## Rewrites (User-Scheduling)

After the frontend pass, we obtain LoopIR. The files in `src/exo/rewrite` implement Exo's rewrite-based user-scheduling process.

- `LoopIR_scheduling.py` is the main file that implements all the scheduling primitives. Many implementations of primitives call into `Check_...` functions, which are the safety checks implemented in `new_eff.py`.
- The handling of analysis to preserve functional equivalence of rewrites is a separate topic not covered in detail here. `new_eff.py`, `new_analysis_core.py`, and `analysis_simplify.py` are all files related to the analysis.
- `LoopIR_unification.py` implements a unification process to support the `replace(p, ...)` rewrite primitive.

---

## Backend

The backend is responsible for lowering LoopIR to C code and performing backend checks, including precision analysis, window analysis, and parallelism analysis.

- `LoopIR_compiler.py` is the main file in the backend, which compiles LoopIR to C code.
- `mem_analysis.py` implements a memory consistency check. For example, if a callee expects an `AVX2` annotation but the caller passes `DRAM` memory, it raises an error.
- `parallel_analysis.py` implements a parallel analysis.
- `prec_analysis.py` implements a precision consistency check and coerces the precision where possible.
- `win_analysis.py` implements a window analysis to check if callee and caller window annotations (tensor or window) match with each other.
