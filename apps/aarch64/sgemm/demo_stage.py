# First, let's use a function to save ourselves from typing too much

    # tile i & j for the kernel
    p = divide_loop(p, 'i', micro_N, ['io', 'ii'], tail='cut_and_guard')

# Ok, now I'm going to use a scheduling operation called divide loop.
# Let me first go ahead and execute this.
# > RUN PYTHON
# - Ok, so we can see here that the `i` loop has been divided in two.
# - If we multiply the extents of those loops we basically get the
#   original loop extent M
# - There is also this second loop created, and note that it loops
#   over a `modulo` or "remainder" amount.

# Ok, let's go over the syntax of the scheduling operation now.
#   1.  the 1st argument is always the procedure to transform
#   2.  the 2nd argument is often a "cursor" telling us where to
#         perform the code transformation within the procedure
#   3.  the 3rd argument to `divide_loop` is the quotient for the division
#   4.  the 4th argument is some names for the new loop iteration variables
#   5.  then we've used the optional argument to specify what should happen
#       to the "remainder" of the division

# ** Show how we can modify the cursor thing to find the loop other ways

# We can repeat this process divide the main `j` loop here too

    p = divide_loop(p, 'j #0', micro_M, ['jo', 'ji'], tail='cut_and_guard')

# Adding the #0 tells us that we want to search for the first occurrence
# > RUN PYTHON

# Now, in order to complete our tiling, we want to re-order the
# ii and jo loops.  However, there's a loop tail in the way.
# We can resolve this by fissioning the body of the ii loop

    # isolate the main chunk of work
    p = fission(p, p.find('for jo in _: _').after(), n_lifts=2)

# Observe that here we find the loop statement, and then get a cursor
# that points to the gap immediately after that statement.

# > RUN PYTHON

# We've fissioned the code all the way up to the top level thanks to our
# optional `n_lifts=2` argument

# Now that we've isolated the main chunk of work, let's reorder the loops

    p = reorder_loops(p, 'ii jo')

# > RUN PYTHON
# Yup!

# INSERT PRINT AFTER MICROKERNEL

# Ok, so now let's look at the microkernel again
# > RUN PYTHON

# Observe that the body of the microkernel roughly matches
# the main inner loops of `sgemm_exo`

# One of the key ideas in Exo is the ability to replace a block of
# statements with an equivalent sub-procedure call.
# Let's just go ahead and do that

    p = replace_all(p, microkernel)

# > RUN PYTHON
# Ok, so we've replaced the inner loops with a call to `microkernel`
# However, this call looks a little funny.  It has all kinds of complicated
# indexing expressions in it.  Let's go ahead and simplify those real quick

    p = simplify(p)

# > RUN PYTHON
# This is better, but still confusing.
# Remember I said I'd come back to this strange "windowing" thing.
#   - explain windowing
#   - REPLACE infers arguments, including the indexing
#     arithmetic needed for windowing

# Alternative: explicit replace
    p = replace(p, "for ii in _:_ #0", microkernel)

# Note that the implementation of `replace_all` is entirely user-level code
# in a standard library.
# Show `scheduling.py` code

# Talk about scheduling as modulating a lowering vs. scheduling as rewriting 


# > RUN BUILD.SH
# - Ok, we've successfully factored our program,
#   but this hasn't had any performance consequences yet.
